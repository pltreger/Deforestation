# Data Visualization of Deforestation

## Presentation
This project was done by a group of 4 students within the Data Visualization teaching of the Master 2 Artificial Intelligence of the Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University during the academic year 2020-2021.

The objective of this project was to represent, with the help of d3js visualizations, the impact of humans on deforestation. Our main problematic was: "How could we show the different human factors responsible for deforestation?".

In order to answer to this problem we have realized several data visualizations. First you will see the global part of each human cause on deforestation. Then you will see a ranking of the countries that impact the most on deforestation. You will also see a visualization comparing for several countries their level of deforestation due to each cause. Finally, a visualization shows the evolution of deforestation from each cause over time for a selected country.
